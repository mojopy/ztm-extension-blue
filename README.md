# ZTM Ext. - Blueified

Fork of the Official extension for Zero To Mastery Academy students.<br>
Forked from version [2023-12-25]

Quick, lazy personal touches for dark mode mainly; No promises made the changes will work as well on your machine or that I will keep this uptodate with the officials.

See the official here: <https://github.com/sithu-khant/ztm-extension>

Main changes: 

* Theme is blueified instead.
* Removes borders (True in both dark and light mode)
* Maximize video size while being able to keep it all in view.
* Button to automatically properly scroll on the video. *(To ameliorate)*
* Darkify scrollbars as well, redundant ones removed.
* Green checkmarks and completion rate, fixed hover icons borders as well.
* Maybe more but I forget...?
