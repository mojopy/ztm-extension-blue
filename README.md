# Zero To Mastery - Extension

Fork of the Official extension for Zero To Mastery Academy students. [2023-12-15]

Personal touches for dark mode mainly; No promises made the changes will work as well on your machine.

See the official here: <https://github.com/sithu-khant/ztm-extension>

Main changes: 

* Theme is blueified instead.
* Removes borders (True in both dark and light mode)
* Darkify scrollbars as well
* Slightly reduced scrollbars widths

- Vidsize version made specifically for me, reduces video player to about 80% its max size so it fits nicely in my browser; not the best method however, it's not all that responsive. May change or further on...

=== Changes made only for the Chrome Extension ===
